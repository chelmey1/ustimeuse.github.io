  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>We are interested in seeing how Americans use their time and how the hours spent on different activities have changed over time. Our goal is to understand how time spent on daily activities differs by gender, income, and age. We also would like to examine whether external factors (such as unemployment rates) influence how time is spent on daily activities by average Americans of different demographics groups.</p>
  <h3>Data</h3>
  <p>The dataset we plan to use is the American Time Use Survey from 2003-2014 provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This data is freely downloadable from the website http://www.bls.gov/tus/. The dataset includes information on survey respondent's labor force status, earnings, total time spent doing each activity (as coded by the BLS), number of household members and non-household members, age, and sex. For unemployment rates, we will use Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey which is also publicly available from the BLS.</p>
  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>A few questions that we would like to answer include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How does a typical American spend his or her day?</li>
    <li>How do factors like income, education, age, and gender affect the leisure/work time distribution?</li>
    <li>How has peopleâ€™s use of time changed during and after the recession?</li>
    <li>Which activities take the most time in a person's day?</li>
  </ul>
